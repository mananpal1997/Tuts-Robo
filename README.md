# Tuts-Robo

A web app to parse textual code from video tutorials, predict the language of code snippet and show you the output.

# Instructions:
A video player is embedded in the Web App. Play the video. Pause it when you want to extract code, click on the capture button. Now, click on top left corner and bottom right corner, specifying dimensions of the box which inscribe the code. The rest will be done on its own.

# Note
It uses ocr to do the work, and learning is not yet implemented, hence, accuracy of extraction is 70-80% only and, font-style and font-size dependant. So, we allow you to edit the code and run again, if it's not extracted correctly.
